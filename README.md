Data Analysis With Pandas Concept Beginner to Advanced

# Here i'm covering all the following Concept 
> Introduction to pandas
> 
     >> Pandas is used as data cleaning tool in the field of data science.You can do whatever operation you want in the dataset with this tool.
 >What does pandas actually do ?

> Dataframe Object
> 
    >> DataFrame is the a main object in pandas.It is used to represent data with rows and columns(tabular or excel spreadshee like data.
    
> Reading, Writing CSV and EXCEL file.
> 
    >> We need to first import pandas module first then import the data from the Excel file into pandas and use the pandas' read_excel method to read in data from the Excel file. 

> Handling Missing Data 
> 
   1) fillna() method 
   2)  Forward fill method 
   3)  Backward fill method 
   4)  dropna() method

> Groupby : Split, Combine and Apply
> 
    >> Groupby is one of the important operations in data analysis.It includes three steps -
 >> 1.Splitting
 >> 2.Applying
   * Aggregation
   * Transformation
   * Filterting
 >> 3. Combine
> Concat Dataframes
> 
    >> Concat is very useful method of pandas.You can concatanate two dataframes in two way -
  >> 1)Append by row
  >> 2)Append by col
> Merging Dataframes
> 
         >> merge() is a method in pandas in which you can merge two dataframes withou repeating columns as we did in
         >> concat() method.
         >> There are two types of merging -
         >>  1) Inner join
         >>  2) outer join
> Pivot and Pivot table
> 
   >> Pivot allows you reshape or trandform your dataset.
   >> Pivot table is used to summarize and aggregate data inside dataframe.

> Reshaping Dataframes
> 
    >> In this technique we will discuss about reshape the dataframe with melt() method.
    >>You have to pass the dataframe and the column which want to keep the same and other argumets are optional for you
